![Restaurant Reviewer](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/cdn/blob/master/restaurant-reviewer/main.jpg?raw=true)


## Getting Started

A proof of cocept restaurant review application built with a focus on accessibility. 

Accesses JSON served from a [Ruby on Rails API](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/restaurant-reviewer-api) containing restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments). Includes an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews are displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

## UX & Accessibility Features
This app integrates [grommet](https://github.com/grommet/grommet), the world's most advanced UX framework.
